```terraform
import {
  to = epilot-workflow_closing_reason.my_epilot-workflow_closing_reason
  id = "..."
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import epilot-workflow_closing_reason.my_epilot-workflow_closing_reason "..."
```
